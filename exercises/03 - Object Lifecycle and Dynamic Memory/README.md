## Gameplan

* Dynamic Memory
	* Stack vs Heap
	* Allocating and freeing memory
	* Arrays
	* Error Checking
* Cannonical Representation
	* Constructor
		* Default Constructor
		* Parametrized Constructor
		* Shallow vs Deep Copy
		* Default Parameters
		* Initilizer List
	* Destructor
		* Lifecycle
		* RAII
	* Copy Constructor
	* Assignment Operator

## Problem

### Define a class Worker that includes:

#### Properties
* Name (no limit)
* Position (no limit)
* Salary

#### Methods
* Cannonical Representation
* Mutators and Selectors
* Print method

### Define a class Factory (We might finish this next time)

#### Properties
* Name (no size limit)
* Array of workers (no size limit)

#### Methods
* Cannonical Representation
* Mutators and Selectors
* Print the name and then every worker in order
* Sort workers by salary
* Add Worker to the end of the array
* Remove worker by name
