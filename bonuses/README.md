# Bonuses

Occasionally, there will be mini assignments (1 or 2 problems) with a shorter time limit (~1 week). Not sending them will NOT reduce your grade. Deadlines are final you can still send problems and receive feedback but they won't be counted. Send assignments as single .cpp files (unless stated otherwise) as private messages in the Slack channel.
